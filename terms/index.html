However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.</p>




        </div><h2 data-target="#collapse2-2" data-toggle="collapse">Subscriptions</h2><div id="collapse2-2" class="collapse">

        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or SHORBY cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting SHORBY customer support team.</p>

        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide SHORBY with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize SHORBY to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, SHORBY will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

        <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by SHORBY until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>

        <p>At any time and without notice, SHORBY reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

        <p>SHORBY will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
